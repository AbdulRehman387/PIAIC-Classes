Increment and Decrement Operator:
 - Q1:
 let a = 2;
let b = ++a * 2; 
// b?
 
- Q2
let x = 5;
let y = x-- + 2;
// y?

 - Q3 
let x = 3;
let y = ++x + x++ + ++x;
// y?

 - Q4 
 let m = 2;
let n = ++m * m++ * --m;
// n?

 - Q5
 let a = 3;
let b = 5;
let result = ++a + b-- - a++ + --b;
// result?

- Q6
let m = 2;
let n = 4;
let p = m++ + ++n - --m + n--;
// m?,n?,p?

 - Q7
 let a = 5;
let b = 3;
let c = 2;
let d = 7;

let result = ++a * (b-- + c) / --d;

// a?, b?, c?, d? ,result?

 - Q8
let m = 2;
let n = 3;
let o = 4;
let result = m++ * (--n + m) / (o-- - n);
// m?, o?, n?, result?
